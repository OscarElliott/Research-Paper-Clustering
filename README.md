## Overview
Clusters research papers based on their abstract similarity. The project makes use of natural language processing, text preprocessing, and unsupervised machine learning.

### HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
For this assesment I have decided to make use of HDBSCAN as it provides a few key advantages over other possiblie unspervised learning models for clustering such as LSA or K-Means. The key advantages being that HDBSCAN:
- There is no need for a predefined number of clusters, I belive we are more focused on density based clusters in this instance
- HDBSCAN identifies and handles noise points (This is its key advantage of DBSCAN)
Both of these advnatges prevent interference from user bias by predefining cluster number or size as well as allowing for the classfication of noise points.
